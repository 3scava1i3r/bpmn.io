    <p class="lead">
      Initiated by camunda, the creators of camundaBPM and Zalando, a german e-commerce champion, bpmn.io aims to bring business processes to everyone.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <a href="http://camunda.com">camunda</a> is a company with a long track record in BPM. Since more than five years we have been helping customers all over the world to apply business process management (BPM) in an effective way. In 2013 we launched <a href="http://camunda.org">camundaBPM</a>, an open-source, extensible platform for business process automation with BPMN 2.0 and Java. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.bpmn.org/">BPMN 2.0</a> is an established global standard for modelling business processes and an important part of our BPM vision. First of all, it allows you to <a href="http://camunda.org/bpmn/tutorial.html">visualize business processes</a>, thus making it easier to capture, discuss and change them. Than again, it also defines a standardized file format that makes it possible to exchange modeled diagrams freely across compliant modeling tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe that the full potential of BPMN can only be unleashed if people get great tooling that is free.
      
      <strong>Those who model</strong> should be able to create and share BPMN 2.0 processes with others: On the web and without restrictions.

      <strong>Those who develop</strong> should be able to visualize processes in their applications and enrich them with the data that is important for application users.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together with Zalando we initiated <a href="http://bpmn.io">bpmn.io</a> as an efford to make that vision come true.
