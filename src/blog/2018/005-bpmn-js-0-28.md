<p class="introduction">
  We are proud to announce the latest release of our BPMN toolkit. The release focuses on internal changes to improve the efficiency and reduce the footprint of our toolkit.
</p>

<!-- continue -->

With this release we replace `lodash`, previously used as our utility library, with [`min-dash`](https://github.com/bpmn-io/min-dash). This change results in ten percent smaller bundle size for our [pre-built BPMN viewer](http://unpkg.com/bpmn-js/dist/).
As a special, all this was supported by a [community contribution](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/issues/234). Would you like to shape the future of our toolkits? Become a contributor, too!

Complete list of (internal) changes:

* `FEAT`: replace `lodash` with `min-dash`
* `FEAT`: update `min-dom` dependency

As part of an ongoing process we are going to roll out these improvements to the majority of our [toolkits and utlities](https://github.com/bpmn-io/), including our soon-to-be-released, revamped DMN toolkit.

Get the latest BPMN toolkit pre-packaged or as source code via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bpmn-js) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/bpmn-js/).
