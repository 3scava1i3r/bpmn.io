<p class="introduction">
  This second [quality rollup](./2017-cmmn-js-0-8.html) of our [CMMN 1.1 viewer and modeler](https://github.com/bpmn-io/cmmn-js) pulls in improvements from our underlying diagram toolkit, fixes several bugs and brings a new way of packaging.
</p>

We have incorporated the following changes into this release:

* `FEAT`: Allow to react to `contextmenu` events
* `CHORE`: Discontinued [bower distribution](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bower-cmmn-js) in favor of packaged bundles, cf. [bpmn-js blog post](./2018-bpmn-js-0-27.html)
* `CHORE`: Improve XML import, validation and export
* `FIX`: React on resize during `Viewer#attachTo`
* `FIX`: Properly detect touch during label editing

If you relied on our old [pre-packaged bundles](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bower-cmmn-js) manual migration is necessary. Read the related [bpmn-js blog post](./2018-bpmn-js-0-27.html) for guidance how to migrate. Checkout our brand new [cmmn-js starters](https://github.com/bpmn-io/cmmn-js-examples/tree/master/starter) if you'd like to play around with the toolkit in no time.
