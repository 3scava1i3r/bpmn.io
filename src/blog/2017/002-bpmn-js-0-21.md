## Label Editing and Text Annotations

Working with text annotations has improved significantly. When editing labels, you now see what you will get once youâ€™re finished editing, regardless of the zoom.

Futhermore, text annotations now automatically resize to fit their content and can be resized, too.


## Snap to Flows when creating and moving Elements

This release brings improvements to dropping elements onto flows. Elements now snap to flows when moving them making it easier to create better-looking diagrams. Simply create a new element from the palette or grab an existing one and drop it onto a flow.
