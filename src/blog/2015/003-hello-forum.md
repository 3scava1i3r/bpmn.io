<p class="introduction">
  Today we open the [bpmn.io forum](https://forum.bpmn.io) to the public. The forum will serve as a friendly place to discuss improvements to our BPMN 2.0 toolkit, investigate rendering or modeling issues as well as get technical and non-technical help. It replaces existing contact forms available on our [website](http://bpmn.io) as well as [demo application](http://demo.bpmn.io).
</p>

<!-- continue -->

The forum is available on [forum.bpmn.io](https://forum.bpmn.io). It provides users with a straight forward way to [file bug reports](https://forum.bpmn.io/t/report-problems) and will serve as a complementary knowledge base for [getting started guides](https://forum.bpmn.io/t/how-to-embed-the-modeler-into-my-applications) as well as [usage examples](https://forum.bpmn.io/t/example-applications-using-bpmn-js) regarding our project.
