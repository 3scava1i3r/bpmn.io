<p class="introduction">
  [Decision Model and Notation (DMN)](http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/) is the upcoming standard for decision modeling by the creators of the BPMN 2.0 standard. We are happy to say that our friends at [Camunda BPM](http://camunda.org) released one of the first web-based table editors for it.

Yesterday the [Camunda BPM](http://camunda.org) team cut the first release of dmn.io. It provides a web-based table editor that reads and writes XML files compliant with the upcoming [Decision Model and Notation standard](http://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/) by the OMG.

The table editor builds on the [same foundation](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) as our modeling toolkit. It comes with [sources on GitHub](https://github.com/dmn-io) and a [demo](http://camunda.org/dmn/demo) that allows you to [create and edit DMN files online](http://camunda.org/dmn/demo).

Make sure to read [their blog post](http://blog.camunda.org/2015/08/first-version-of-dmnio-released.html) and give them feedback whether or not you like the demo.
