The bpmn.io desktop app is something we have been working on since last years [BPMCon](http://www.bpmcon.de). It packages our BPMN modeler and can be installed onto your computer via the [chrome app store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bpmnio/hhikcjnalmkhinbomccdibaolelcpjli). Today we are proud to release it as a first stable version.
